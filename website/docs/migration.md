title: Migration
---

This chapter is not for library authors, but users. We explain here a new syntax and how to migrate from `v2.0` to `v3.0`.

> **LIBRARY AUTHORS.**
> Legacy syntax (v2.0) is deprecated but still supported through API of GraphQL Config v3.0. As a library author, you consume GraphQL Config API as usual, the legacy syntax is backported to new one under the hood.

## Migration tool

We prepared a command-line tool to help you migrate your legacy GraphQL Config:

    npx graphql-config-migrate

The migration tool will ask few questions and move your config files to the new syntax.

## New Syntax

### schemaPath

Read ["Usage" chapter](user-usage.md#schema) to understand the `schema` field.

```diff

+ schema: "schema.graphql"

Minor change here, remove the `s` at the end. The logic behind `include` and `exclude` stays the same but please read about it in ["Usage" chapter](./usage#include--exclude).

+ include: "src/*.graphql"
```

```diff
- excludes: "tests/*.graphql"
+ exclude: "tests/*.graphql"
```

```
